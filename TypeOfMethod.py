##############  Instance Method  ##############
# 1- is a method that is bound to the instance of the class.
# 2- This method can access or modify the state of the class and instance.
# 3- takes self as the first parameter
# 4- mostly used to access or change the attributes of the object on which they are called.
# 5- can be called only by the objects of the class


##############  Class Method  ##############
# 1- is a method that is bound to the class.
# 2- This method can access or modify the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class.
# 3- takes cls as the first parameter
# 4- We use @classmethod decorator To define a class method
# 5- We use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
# 6- can be called by the objects of the class as well as by the class itself


##############  Static Method  ##############
# 1- is a method that is bound to the class.
# 2- This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
# 3- needs no specific parameters.
# 4- we use @staticmethod decorator to define a static method .
# 5- We use static methods to create utility functions.
# 6- can be called by the objects of the class as well as by the class itself
